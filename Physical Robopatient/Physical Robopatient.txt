Physical Robopatient folder contains:
- code for implementing the pain sound algorithm 
- raw data
- processed data files called Block 1 and Block 2

Block 1 contains data from trials with only facial expression feedback.
Block 2 contains data from trials with facial and audio pain expression feedback.

– peaks: The palpation force (N) as shown
– timestamps: Time stamps (s) for each palpation point 
– xpos: x-position (mm) extrapolated from the time stamps
– mu: Maximum pain point x_t
– order: The order that the participant performed the experiment. 1 = participant performs the experiment with only facial expression feedback for the first 1-10 trial and with facial and audio pain expression feedback for the second 11-20 trial. 2 = participant performs the experiment with facial and audio pain expression feedback for the first 1-10 trial and with only facial expression feedback for the second 11-20 trial
